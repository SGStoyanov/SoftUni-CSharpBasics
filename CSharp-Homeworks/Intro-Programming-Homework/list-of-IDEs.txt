MonoDevelop enables developers to quickly write desktop and ASP.NET Web applications on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. MonoDevelop makes it easy for developers to port .NET applications created with Visual Studio to Linux and Mac OSX maintaining a single code base for all platforms.

5. #develop (short for SharpDevelop) is a free IDE for C#, VB.NET and Boo projects on Microsoft's .NET platform. It is open-source and a good alternative of Microsoft Visual Studio.

6. Adobe Dreamweaver - Adobe Dreamweaver is a proprietary web development tool developed by Adobe Systems.
