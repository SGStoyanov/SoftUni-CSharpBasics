Problem 13.	C# and .NET Differences
Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences. Write your description in a text file called “csharp-and-dot-net-framework.txt”. Use English.


C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run. .NET is the framework that C# is built on. The .NET libraries can run on the CLR and thus any language which can run on the CLR can also use the .NET libraries.
